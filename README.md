hmm...This is a personal self-use ahk script :)
  
It makes my workflow much more convenient, and there are no conflicts with other Live shortcuts.
  
I emulated the source code of [Live Enhancement Suite](https://github.com/LiveEnhancementSuite/LESforWindows) for reference. Hope you find it useful!
  
## How To Run
  
1. Download & Install [AutoHotKey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/)
  
2. Run `Ableton-Shortcuts.ahk` with AutoHotKey v2
  
3. Then you can start making a DOOOOOPE song...  
  
## Features
  
- Quick Insert Effects
- Swap `TAB` and `SHIFT+TAB`
- Redo with `CTRL+SHIFT+Z`
- Close the Activated Plugin Window with `ESC`
- Create a Non-looped Midi Clip
- And more...

Anyways,  
  
Ableton Live + AutoHotKey = 最強のDAW!!!
